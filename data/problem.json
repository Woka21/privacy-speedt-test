        "question": "Why does my internet keep disconnecting every few minutes?",
        "answer": "Internet disconnections every few minutes are usually caused by router issues, ISP problems, or interference. Try restarting your router first, then check for service outages in your area. If using Xfinity, check the xFi app for network status."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it normal for internet to disconnect occasionally?",
        "answer": "Occasional disconnections (once per week) can happen, but daily disconnections indicate a problem. Contact your ISP if basic troubleshooting doesn't help and the issue persists for more than a day."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I contact my ISP if internet keeps disconnecting?",

      {
        "question": "Can my ISP slow down my internet?",
        "answer": "Yes, ISPs can throttle speeds during peak hours (7-11 PM) or if you exceed data caps. Contact them if you suspect throttling, especially if speeds drop significantly at specific times daily."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is my internet slow only at night?",

        "question": "Why is my WiFi slower than ethernet?",

        "question": "How much slower should WiFi be than ethernet?",
